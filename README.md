# Connect 4

An academic team project in which we had to conceive the best Connect4 AI. Then, we tested our AI in a competition between all students of school year. 

Here is some informations about the context :
<ul>
<li>To improve the difficulty of the assignment for the AI the game grid has been expand to 12 columns and 6 rows.</li>
<li>The total number of tokens was 21 per player and the goal remained to align 4 tokens.</li>
<li>AI was ranked according to their game result (win or lose) and their play' speed.</li>
</ul>
